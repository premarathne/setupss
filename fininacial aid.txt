I am an undergraduate of Wayamba University of SriLanka. I am following computer science special degree. My father died in 2007.My mother is a labor. She earns 800 rupees per day.I have an elder sister.she suffers from mental disorder since 2005.we have lots of economic problems.So I am unable to pay this course.Lots of money have to be spend for my sisters medicines. Mother's daily salary is not enough to full fill our day to day work even.I am working at a grossery shop in my holidays to earn some money.I spend that money to my educational work and for our family.I am interested in data science,specially building machine learning models ad also Convolutional neural network.I know the coursera is the best place to obtain  a good knowledge the person like us who are unable to pay for do a professorial course.so I am kindly request to give me a chance to this course freely.I hope to do my best in this course to earn maximum benefits.


I hope to continue my journey in data science.Specially I am interested in doing projects based on neural networks and machine learning.while I am doing projects with machine learning .Then I need better statistic knowledge specially in linear regressions and also deep knowledge of machine learing algorithms.So this course is best place to gain that knowledge.After completing such professional course from coursera ,the certificate that I will be earned adding a great value to my curriculum vitae when I will facing for interview to get a job in data science.So doing this course is not only help full to my studies but also to turn my future path into a better way.To build machine learning predictive models it is essential of having good foundation or sound knowlege of machine learning concepts .So I should have better knowledge of Machine learing specially to face the problems in projects of machine learning model building in data science field.So this course is the place to learn machine learning with starting basics to gain high sound knowledge at the end of the course. To success my future I hope I'll be lucky to follow this course form a professorial place like "coursera".
